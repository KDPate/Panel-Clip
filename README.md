# Voron Panel-Clip
Clips for Voron panels.

3.5 mm thickness (2.5 mm panel with 1 mm foam)
5.5 mmm thickness (2.5 mm panel with 3 mm foam)

Vase mode
.6mm extrusion width
.2mm layer height (I'm sure other heights will work)

Using a stealthburner on a 2.4 I am able to print these in ABS at 50mm/s with 100% fan. That's greater than 10mm per minute.
