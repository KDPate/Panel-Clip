# Voron 2.4 Panel Clip
Clips for Voron panels.

Concept by zruncho (voron discord), tweaks by me.

They are flexible enough to easily install and remove, yet since they are full length, provide enough force to hold the panel snugly to the extrusion. These are optimized for formbot kit extrusions (which I think are virtually identical to misumi). Other extrusions make require tweaking the flange separation to get the right balance of ease of insertion/removal and holding power.

* For 3.5 mm thickness (2.5 mm panel with 1 mm foam)
* For 5.5 mmm thickness (2.5 mm panel with 3 mm foam)


Printing:
- Vase mode with no top or bottom layers
- .6mm extrusion width
- .2mm layer height (I'm sure other heights will work)
- Brim to hold it down. If you do print a bottom layer on it, it will need to be removed to get the necessary flexibility for easy installation and removal.

Using a stealthburner on a 2.4 I am able to print these in ABS at 50mm/s with 100% fan. That's greater than 10mm per minute.
